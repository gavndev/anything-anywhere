## Overview
Anything Anywhere is a web application designed to help users discover popular media and destinations from anywhere in the world. Unlike standard map applications that focus solely on places and reviews, Anything Anywhere expands the experience by including popular songs, artwork, and other forms of media.

## Current Stage
The project is currently in the development stage. Key features being worked on include:
- Integration of map functionalities for discovering places and reviews.
